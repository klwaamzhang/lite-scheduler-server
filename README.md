 ## Introduction
 Lite Scheduler is a web application which could use on cross-platform (pc, phone or tablet) for people who want to schedule the daily tasks. Users could add the daily tasks to the scheduler to manage their works and time.

 ## Functionality
 In this app, you could:
* Add and manage your schedule without login (Your data will be stored in your browser)
* Login as regular, student or senior user, enjoy the different scheduler layouts and functions
* Login to save your schedule permanently, no need to worry losing schedules
* Update your info or switch your account to any type of the user layout to fit what you need
* <del>Send Email to you before an important event is coming</del> (still in development)

## Web back end end techniques
 In this app, we use:
 * NodeJS and ExpressJS for APIs request and response
 * RESTful API and Mongo query to request and retrieve data
 * <del>Nodemailer and Node-schedule for sending email functionality</del> (It needs to be improved since Gmail security reason)
 * MongoDB Atlas as the database to store data on cloud
